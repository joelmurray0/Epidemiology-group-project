    "#### Background\n",
    "Epidemiological models are increasingly used during infectious disease outbreaks to make outbreak projections and to guide control interventions. This project involves developing simple computational models of outbreaks and using them to predict the effects of different interventions. It also involves using stochastic epidemiological models (models that include randomness) to predict the risk that early cases at the beginning of an outbreak lead on to a major epidemic (with a large number of cases) as opposed to fade out as a minor outbreak (with a small number of cases). \n",

Plot a graph of ${\\rm Prob}(M > m)$ as a function of $m$, for the default parameter values described in Task A5 above (compute the probability by running a large number of stochastic simulations and calculating the proportion of simulations in which $M>m$). Hint: You only have to run the simulations once (rather than running multiple simulations for each value of $m$).\n",
    "- Add a vertical line to the plot marking the value of $m$ that corresponds to the (positive) solution to the \"final size equation\" described in the Lecture (note: you will have to look up an appropriate Python function to solve this equation numerically, as in Task A2 above).\n",

Estimating the risk from invading pathogens using practical definitions of a severe epidemic\" by Thompson, Gilligan and Cunniffe (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsif.2020.0690). The key difference between the stochastic SIR model and the stochastic SIS model is that, in the stochastic SIS model, individuals go back into the $S$ compartment when they recover (rather than entering the $R$ compartment). Pick either the \"Final size\" or \"Duration\" definition of a severe epidemic described in that paper, and write code to reproduce the relevant figure from that article using model simulations (either Fig 4a or Fig 4b; n.b. you are only required to reproduce the solid lines in the chosen figure). Hint: You do not have to simulate the model until $I$ hits zero to make this figure - that might take a very long time. Instead, you can stop each simulation as soon as the relevant maximum value on the x-axis is exceeded (or when $I$ hits zero, if that occurs first).\n",

However, the SIR model is quite simple and does not include some important features that affect transmission of pathogens in the real world.

A good guide for what the final notebook should be like is: if the notebook is run and all code cells and task descriptions are collapsed, the notebook should be readable as a short report, primarily consisting of a short introduction to each section followed by figures and descriptions of the figures.\n",

Each code cell should begin with a comment line or lines concisely stating what the cell is for (alternatively, precede the code cell with a markdown cell explaining what you are about to do). Functions should have comments describing what they do. It can be assumed that the reader understands Python to a basic level (e.g. comments like \"Create an array\" or \"Make a plot\" on every line are unnecessary). Add comments to set off blocks of code or to note anything tricky.\n",
